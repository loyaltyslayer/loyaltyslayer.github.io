        <p><strong>Genshin impact</strong> is a fun. It is also a pain in the neck of a game and here is why. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Reason number one</strong>, artifact hunting. Let me tell you there is nothing more upseting then doing a domain for 3 hours and getting defense stat artifact on a cryo goblet with 3 defenses rolls. 
        </p>
        <p>
           <strong>Reason number two</strong>, the accension quest. They are the most annoying thing you have to do. When I tell you I am stuck at adventure rank 45 until I finsh inazuma, gosh. I do not care about the rewards I care about catching up in the story line.
        </p>
        <p>
           <strong>Reason number 3</strong>4, pulling for characters. Imagine this, spending money just to get a flipping qiqi on a pull for a limited time character banner.  I wanted a cool character, not a zombie doctor that can't remember anything.  It's awful until the graceful moment of getting the character that you want.  then everything is okay again.
